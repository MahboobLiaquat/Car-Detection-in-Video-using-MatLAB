# Car-Detection-in-Video-using-MatLAB
This repository contains the MATLAB implementation of a car detection algorithm using Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) and the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. This was developed as a project for ENCS6161: Probability and Stochastic Processes at Concordia University (Winter 2023).
